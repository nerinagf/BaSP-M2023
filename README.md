# Become a Software Professional 2023
## Week 1
````
The objective of the first week consisted of a screenflow. We had to deisgn a system to administrate a gym: the time grid, schedule of the employees and the activities and memberships.
This objective was to do the screenflow of this application using Figma.
````
We divided in small groups and each of them had to work on a different frame of the screenflow. Each group had to create one of the pages for the app, some teams had to make a desktop page for a different user of the program, and other team was asked to make a landing page with different sections.
To send the finished work, we copied the link to the web prototype that was generated from Figma.
## Week 2
```
The goals of the second week consisted in:
- Being able to create a HTML document with semantic content
- Being able to save our progress in a local repository and a remote one
The problem for this week was to creat a HTML document that has the same content of the landing page of the screenflow that was made the first week, using the desktop version
```
We worked individually, we created the HTML file and added every content that can be seen in every version (title, subtitle, dates, text, images, links, etc.) and we were asked to create a Repository in GitHub, save the progress in Git and then make the commits needed to connect both repositories.
To upload the finished work, we have to send the link of the GitHub repository
## Week 3
```
The problem for this week was to include the styles corresponding to the HTML structure of the previous week so that the page looks identical to the screenflow landing page in Figma.
```
We added a "Week 3" folder in the repository created before, copied the index.html created in week 2 and paste it in the new folder. Before working in CSS, we had to make all the corrections from the feedback of the previous work. Inside the Week 3 folder, we created a CSS file and we also had to include a reset.css file. As we did in the previous weeks, we had to update our progress in Git and push it to our existing repository in GitHub.
The finish work was uploaded with the link to that Repository.
## Week 4
```
The objective of the week was to replicate the Figma landing page using Flexbox as the main tool for the creation of a Responsive Design following the Mobile First concept.
```
We created a Week 4 folder inside the repository, copied the index.html and paste it into the folder. Then we had to create the necessary CSS files to ensure reuse of these styles. The first thing we had to develop was the mobile version and apply CSS Flexbox rules so that the same content adapts to mobile, tablet and desktop. We also had to enable Github Pages to be able to view the front page online from the Github page. 
To send the finished work, we had to submit the Github Pages link from the index.html.
