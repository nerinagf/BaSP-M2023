# Become a Software Professional 2023
## Week 1
````
The objective of the first week consisted of a screenflow. We had to deisgn a system to administrate a gym: the time grid, schedule of the employees and the activities and memberships.
This objective was to do the screenflow of this application using Figma. 
````
We divided in small groups and each of them had to work on a different frame of the screenflow. Each group had to create one of the pages for the app, some teams had to make a desktop page for a different user of the program, and other team was asked to make a landing page with different sections.  
To send the finished work, we copied the link to the web prototype that was generated from Figma.
## Week 2
```
The goals of the second week consisted in: 
- Being able to create a HTML document with semantic content
- Being able to save our progress in a local repository and a remote one
The problem for this week was to creat a HTML document that has the same content of the landing page of the screenflow that was made the first week, using the desktop version
```
We worked individually, we created the HTML file and added every content that can be seen in every version (title, subtitle, dates, text, images, links, etc.) and we were asked to create a Repository in GitHub, save the progress in Git and then make the commits needed to connect both repositories.  
To upload the finished work, we have to send the link of the GitHub repository
